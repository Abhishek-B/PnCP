    "# PnCP\n",
    "\n",
    "This MATLAB package is built for quantum entanglement detection and constructing positive maps which are not completely positive.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "- [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/) or [SeDuMi](https://sedumi.ie.lehigh.edu/)\n",
    "- [YALMIP (2019 April release)](https://yalmip.github.io/R20190425) \n",
    "\n",
    "PnCP has been tested on Ubuntu and MacOS. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "To use PnCP, add the entire matlab archive to path. The 'demo.m' file demonstrates the two main commands. \n",
    "### Generating a positive map which is not completely positive (pncp map). \n",
    "To generate a (rational) positive map $\\Phi:\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times 3}\\mapsto\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times 3}$ use the ``Gen_PnCP`` command, e.g.,\n",
    "```\n",
    "Phi = Gen_PnCP(3,3,'mosek','CNR',2,2,rationalize=1);\n",
    "```\n",
    "Details for the input arguments can be learnt using\n",
    "```\n",
    "help('Gen_PnCP')\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Testing Entanglement of a Quantum State\n",
    "Given a quantum state $\\rho$ along with its density matrix $P$, to generate a rational pncp map which can detect the entanglement of $\\rho$, use the command ``Ent_PnCP``, e.g.\n",
    "```\n",
    "output = Ent_PnCP(M,N,m,P,attempts);\n",
    "Phi = output{1,1};\n",
    "ampliation = output{1,2};\n",
    "```\n",
    "where $M, N$ are the dimensions of the composite systems for $\\rho$, $m$ is the dimension of the codomain of the desired $\\Phi$ and ``attemps`` is the number of trials to conduct.  \n",
    "Details for the input arguments can be learnt using\n",
    "```\n",
    "help('Ent_PnCP')\n",
    "```\n",
    "If only a floating point map $\\Phi$ is required, there is a similar command ``EntF_PnCP``.\n",
